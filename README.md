# README
This is a basic rails application i started that i use as a kitchen sink project. That means it is messy, unpolished and sometimes the features dont make total sense in the context of the app but did make sense at the time, or i just wanted to make that feature. It conceptually similiar to reddit. Users can post content and comments as well as like any piece of content. I hope to continue to expand the features out and eventually get it to pull content from reddit. 

Why reddit specifically you may ask. "Start with what you know" i always say. I use reddit every day. it is my social media addiction of choice so it seemed like a natural candidate when i wanted a kitchen sink project. Reddit has alot of functionality that will take me a long time at my current level to copy, and alot of potential functionality that sounded fun to build.
